    * Sets some GitHub security policies, e.g., must have SECURITY.md, etc. It is related to ScoreCards - enforces some of the same things. The name is a play on “scorecard” - if you get a good score you’re an all-star.

        * There’s little time before the next NIST response is due. The Planning Committee won’t try to coordinate a response in that little time, but we’ll share information as individuals prepare their own responses (as individuals choose)
    * Identify EO-Critical OSS Projects
        * Securing Critical Projects WG
    * Generate evidence demonstrating conformance to EO requirements
        * Security Best Practices WG / Identifying Security Threats WG?
* Questions
    * CRoB: Best Practices WG is trying to create more prescriptive guidance on what developers should do; needs to synergize with tools WG. Would it be better to approach this as a collective project of the OpenSSF as a whole?
        * Suggestion: follow publishing immediately with a poll to ask what else readers would like to see
        * Suggestion: make this a living document
        * CRoB to send out email
    * CRoB: OpenSSF Reference Architecture (project for Black Hat)
        * Shows interactions between groups and projects.
        * David: Suggest paper with diagram
        * CRoB: Dynamic graphic allows clicking to repositories with readme for people to learn how to get involved.
        * Sal: Make sure people can find points of contact
        * Jennifer: Mark things that are collaboration across projects, consider color coding
        * David: Make them all hyperlinks - then people can quickly get to the info. There are nits that I think need to be fixed (need to make overlaps bigger to fit info & CHAOSS should be partly outside since it’s really an external project), but I love the approach.
        * Next Steps:
            * CRoB to move diagram to editable format, share with others.
