## Requests through the OpenSSF Marketing Committee

### Communications and content

To post on the OpenSSF blog, projects should contact the OpenSSF Marketing Committee with a blog draft two weeks before the requested publication date. The Committee does their best to accommodate requested publication dates, but projects should plan to be flexible during high-traffic times (e.g. events). Posts and timing is at the editorial discretion of the Marketing Committee; posts must follow the Code of Conduct, be relevant to the OpenSSF mission, and not promote vendor or commercial products. 

To receive space in an OpenSSF newsletter, projects should contact the Marketing Committee a minimum of two weeks before the newsletter publication date. Projects are responsible for tracking due dates and submitting materials.

### Contributor meet ups at OpenSSF events

Projects that would like contributor meet up space at OpenSSF events should contact the OpenSSF Marketing Committee with a request six months before the event date, or as soon as the event is announced if it is less than six months. Late requests may be accommodated but are not guaranteed. The events team handles room reservations, attendee registration if necessary, and connecting the project leads to event and facility support staff. Projects are responsible for organizing and running their own contributor meet up.

### Swag

The OpenSSF Marketing Committee keeps a small, annual swag stipend for all projects. Projects may wish to seek outside funding for project swag beyond this stipend.

## Requests through the OpenSSF Budget Committee
Requests that go through the OpenSSF Budget Committee are reviewed at regularly occuring Budget Committee meetings. Projects should plan their funding needs and requests with this timeline in mind.

### Infrastructure

_Program TBD as of June 2022. Intended program details below._
Central infrastructure is available to qualifying projects for test and build support. Projects should submit requests on an annual basis to the OpenSSF Budget Committee, a minimum of three months before the requested start date. Projects are responsible for submitting a resource forecast with their request. The Budget Committee and project will work together to agree on minimum infrastructure support based on annual budget. Projects are responsible for communicating to the Budget Committee if there are anticipated increases (including spike events) arise. 

### Maintainer stipends

_Program TBD as of June 2022. Intended program details below._
Limited, time-bound maintainer stipends for specified project improvements may be available to qualifying projects. Projects should submit a request to the OpenSSF Budget Committee with proposed scope, cost, desired outcome, TAC sponsor approval, and timeline at least three months before the requested start date. Maintainer stipends may not be paid to employees of OpenSSF member companies (excludes Associate members).

### Security audits and improvements

Qualifying projects may request funding for security audits and other services offered by third party security professionals. Before creating a request for proposals, projects should confirm funding availability with the OpenSSF Budget Committee. After receiving proposals, projects should request their selected proposal be funded through the Budget Committee. Projects who need assistance creating an RFP should contact the OpenSSF Planning Committee. RFPs must be posted in a public channel(s) (GitHub issue, mailing list). OpenSSF member companies may bid on RFPs. 

## Other

### Code of Conduct support

All projects must follow the [OpenSSF Code of Conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct/). If projects receive reports of conduct violations, they should report them to conduct@openssf.org.

### Vulnerability disclosure assistance

Qualifying projects may request assistance with coordinated disclosure from the Vulnerability Disclosure Working Group. **This assistance is restricted to understanding the disclosure process and workflow steps** and troubleshooting common coordination scenarios such as, "The researcher has not responded, how do I proceed?" Vulnerability details should not to be shared in this forum. Projects may request assistance by contacting the Vuln Disclosure WG Chair. 

### Additional requests

Qualifying projects may raise funds for additional projects. Projects should present a fundraising objective, targeted amount, desired outcomes and milestones for approval by the TAC. With TAC approval, OpenSSF staff will assist projects in setting up and coordinating collecting additional funds.
