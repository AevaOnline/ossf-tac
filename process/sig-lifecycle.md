# Special Interest Group (SIG) Life Cycle

Special Interest Groups are under the direct governance of a Working Group (WG) which can create and close them as necessary and appropriate. SIGs are expected to have a very specific goal and not necessarily live for a very long time.

The lifecycle of SIGs is therefore minimal and as follows.

## Active

* The SIG is actively pursuing its goal.

## Inactive

* The SIG is no longer active, either it has completed its mission or the mission was abandoned.
